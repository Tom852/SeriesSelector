## About
Do you know this problem?
Since nobody shares his/her Netflix subscription with you,
you were forced to download your favorite series from the internet.
You binge watched about half of them,
but the next day,
you have no clue were you stopped watching.
Let this tool help you!

## What it does
You can add any folder of your filesystem to the program.
Whenever you click on the big button, the displayed file is opened and the file marker is increased by one.
The next time you click, the next file will be played.
The state will be rememebered, thus, the next day, you can directly continue to watch where you stopped.

##  Usabilty Hints
* To delete a series, mark it and press delete.
* To navigate quickly thorugh a folder, right click the arrow button.
* You can also use the software for other things like pictures or music.
* If your episodes contain a season and episode index of the format SSxEE,
e.g. 06x12,
the filename prior to this will be cropped of,
since I assume its just a repetition of the serie's name.

## Why is it so big??
Well, because you are chillin on your sofa when using this tool.
Thus, you are far away from your screen!
The button colors are fixed per series and help you to identify your desired series.
